#Milestone 1
##Brief description
Overall description: sports stats application that allows users to query a sports (eg basketball) database. Example use cases: 1. Input a stat line, return players from previous games with same/similar stats. 2. Input a formula based on stats, return table of players sorted by value associated with the formula

##Plan for getting data
We will get our data directly from the National Basketball Association via the APIs on its webiste, stats.nba.com. We plan to leverage an existing Python module, py-Goldsberry, to scrape data from the site into a form that we can enter into our database.
