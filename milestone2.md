#Milestone 2

We spend the majority of the work on this milestone setting up the infrastructure for our application- creating a basic web interface and actually acquiring the production dataset to ensure that we can convert it into a format that we can use in our SQL database. The web application is written in Python using Flask, co-opted from the example on the class website. As stated previously, the data is accessed from stats.nba.com using an existing Python module. We did not make any changes to E/R design and table schema during work on this milestone.
