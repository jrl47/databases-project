#Milestone 2

##Completed tasks

##Tasks left
* Setup MEAN stack
* Make any changes to use cases
* Design visual interface to work with use cases we have
* Learn about MongoDB: how it works, best way to run it within an app, etc.
* Based on web interface and understanding of MongoDB/how the data will be stored within the app, plan out the broad design of the app (so we can implement the "hello world" prototype thing mentioned in the project page)
* Provide visualizations of stats
